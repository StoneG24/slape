// Pacakge rag is for working with rag solutions in order to aid in context generation for our slms.
// These solutions should be easy to use on low end hardware since this is intended for consummer grade hardware.
package rag

// The current plan is to implement, MiniRag, https://github.com/HKUDS/MiniRAG.
// This would allow for fast parsing of documents that could aid in getting slms
// more instruction on how to perform their tasking.
