// Package pipline is meant to help facilitate the running of several models in sequential order.
//
// For machines with small amounts of resources the pipelines will have to manage models by orchestrating models as need be.
// Pipelines also dictate the structure of conversations between the models. See the following docs for more info.
// All pipelines are based off of prompting techniques that are used in the realm of Test Time Compute(TTC) optimization.
