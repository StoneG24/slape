// I'm envisioning this as being the function/component that just houses the currently selected page.

export default function App() {

    // You'd have the logic for which page is currently selected. Still not really sure how this will work but we'll figure it out
    return (
        <>
            {/* Here, you'd have page*/ }
        </>
    );
}

// Stone, we may need to brainstorm how we can change pages here. I'm trying to think, but I can't seem to land on a good way to do it. Maybe we can pass a pointer to a string or something that selects which page is currently active?
